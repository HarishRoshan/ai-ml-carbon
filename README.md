Project Summary
This project presents a machine learning-based solution for predicting carbon emissions using structured environmental and energy-related data. The objective is to support sustainability and environmental planning by delivering accurate carbon emission estimates through data-driven modeling.

Repository Contents
ai ml carbon.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook containing the complete workflow, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

flat.csv: The dataset containing relevant features used to build and validate the predictive models.

Objectives
Clean, analyze, and visualize environmental data related to carbon emissions.

Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict emission values.

Compare model performance and select the most effective approach for accurate prediction.

Explore practical applications in environmental monitoring and carbon management.

Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

pandas – Data manipulation

numpy – Numerical operations

matplotlib, seaborn – Data visualization

scikit-learn – Machine learning and model evaluation

Methodology
Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values and inconsistent data entries

Feature selection and normalization where applicable

Exploratory Data Analysis

Examined feature distributions and correlations using visualizations

Model Development

Applied Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression (degree 2)

Trained models using supervised learning techniques

Model Evaluation

Assessed performance using R² Score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Results
The Polynomial Regression model achieved an R² score of 1.0000, indicating a perfect fit to the data.

Predictions align exactly with the actual values in the dataset, suggesting highly accurate performance under current conditions.

Note: An R² score of 1.0000 should be carefully reviewed, as it may indicate overfitting if the model complexity is high relative to dataset size.

Future Enhancements
Validate the model on external or unseen datasets to assess generalizability

Experiment with regularization techniques (e.g., Ridge, Lasso) to avoid overfitting

Explore advanced models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks

Develop a web-based interface for user interaction and real-time predictions
